[**Ulrike Krewer Dr.-Ing.**](https://www.iam.kit.edu/et/english/mitarbeiter_5189.php) is a Full Professor and Head of the Institute for Applied Materials – Electrochemical Technologies at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. She received a PhD in Process Engineering from University/Max Planck Institute Magdeburg. After researching in Samsung (Korea) and an Assistant Professorship, she became Full Professor for Energy and Process Systems Engineering at TU Braunschweig in 2012, and moved to her current position KIT in 2020. With more than 20 years of research expertise in electrochemical energy technologies, she and her team contribute(d) to advancing established technologies, such as Li-ion batteries and PEM electrolysis, as well as exploratory ones such as Li/Na-metal batteries and CO2 electrolysis. Model-based and dynamic analysis of processes at electrodes allows her to reveal performance limiting steps and the (degradation) state of cells and electrodes, and to propose improvements.

**Abstract:** Electrochemical technologies offer efficient and dynamic storage of electrical energy in batteries or – via electrolysis – in hydrogen. In addition, power-to-chemicals technologies, such as electrochemical CO2 conversion or production of expensive fine chemicals, promise a deep energy transition of the chemical industry. Almost all new electrochemical technologies, but also established ones, suffer from performance losses due to a lack of quantitative insight into processes in the cells. Modelling tools at higher levels are already well established and predictive, when it comes to heat and mass transfer, as these phenomena are widespread in (chemical) engineering. They struggle, however, to reproduce or predict the electrochemical behaviour of electrodes.

This talk covers established and upcoming electrochemical energy and power-to-chemical technologies, their application and state of development. The complexity and challenges of the technologies at electrode level are complemented by strategies how to formulate and parameterise suitable models. The models are then used to give insight into the many unmeasurable processes or states, and for virtual design of better catalysts, electrodes, cells or operating conditions.

<h2>An ongoing journey toward model-based control and optimization in the presence of uncertainties</h2>

**Abstract:** This plenary talk addresses the general objective of how to control and optimize a process system based on an available model which, in general, describes the actual process behavior in an approximate way. The presence of systematic uncertainties, such as gain errors, poses challenges to model-based control and optimization systems so that without adequate compensation strategies there is permanently suboptimal behavior, such as offset. 
The talk is meant to guide the audience through the design principles of Model Predictive Control (MPC) systems to cope with the presence of a structural mismatch between the actual plant and the MPC model. The general goal is to asymptotically reach the optimal behavior for the actual unknown plant. 

The talk will be structured into two main parts. 
We start from the case of tracking, linear and nonlinear, MPC to build a general algorithm framework that guarantees offset-free tracking of piece-wise constant set-points in the outputs. To this aim, the nominal model is augmented with integrating states, referred to as “disturbances”, and a combined state and disturbance observer is consequently designed. We analyze the requirements and opportunities of this disturbance observer and discuss how other approaches, commonly thought to be different, are indeed particular cases of this general approach. 
In the second part, we focus attention on so-called economic MPC formulations, in which the cost function is not positive-definite around the optimal equilibrium. For this novel class of MPC systems, we present the recent results on offset-free design which includes, in addition to an augmented model as in tracking MPC, a suitable first-order modifier necessary to achieve matching of the necessary conditions of optimality. Computation of such modifiers requires, in principle, knowledge of plant gradient information, and therefore we discuss implementation strategies based on available input-output measurements only.  These offset-free economic MPC algorithms are closely related to Real-Time Optimization methods, and hence the necessary lines of conjunction will be drawn.

Several examples of process control systems are presented as case studies to strengthen the main founding concepts and the recommended design practices.
We conclude the lecture by sketching future research directions and open problems.

<h2>Advances and Opportunities of AI in Process Industries</h2>

**Abstract:** To enhance safety, reliability, and productivity of industrial processes and to accelerate materials discovery, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques have been widely used in process industries for many decades.  In the current Industry 4.0 and digital era, AI propels advancement in a wide range of applications including image analytics, Natural language process (NLP), deep learning, reinforcement learning, hybrid modeling, and real-time analytics.  
 
As more AI successes are demonstrated in process industries, there is a growing misconception that AI is to replace human decision.  The talk will highlight the importance of Responsible/Trustworthy AI and show industrial examples on how humans and AI must be working in the loop.  One aspect is to understand how to incorporate AI methods to assist humans to accelerate discovery in research and to make well-informed decisions in manufacturing operations.  The other aspect is to allow humans to incorporate engineering and science domain knowledge to make AI methods smarter.  This talk will conclude by highlighting future research direction, workforce development need, and how academia, vendors, and industries must collaborate to unlock more value with AI.
