## Manuscript Requirements and Submission Categories
All papers and invited session proposals must be written in English and submitted through [PaperCept](https://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

**Regular Papers:** 6 pages, up to 8 with extra page charge of $165 CAD ($120 USD equivalent) per page. 

**Invited Sessions Proposals:** Proposals must describe a research topic and include titles, authors and abstracts of 6 papers by authors who agreed to submit an invited session paper on this topic. Proposers will be invited to chair the session if it is accepted. 

**Invited Session Papers:** 6 pages, up to 8 pages with extra page charge of $165 CAD ($120 USD equivalent) per pag. Submission requires a code provided by the organizers of the invited session. 

**Industrial Extended Abstracts:** 2-6 pages, first and corresponding author(s) must be from industry. Industrial Extended Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings.

**Pre-Conference Workshop Proposals:** We are accepting proposals for pre-conference workshops on topics related to modeling, estimation, optimization, and control of process systems. The workshop proposals must provide a detailed description of the workshop objectives, target audience, and tentative schedule. Workshop organizers are strongly encouraged to form a diverse session along dimensions such as gender, geography, industry/academia affiliation, and other forms of diversity.

Two paper submissions are allowed per full registration, and one per student registration.

We note that papers for IFAC events are supposed to be no longer than 6 pages, and the possibility to extend to up to 8 pages was announced due to a misunderstanding only. A one-time exception to allow papers with more than 6 pages has been granted by IFAC because this mistake was only spotted after all final submissions had been collected
