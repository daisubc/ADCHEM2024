# Call for Papers

The International Program Committee (IPC) invites authors to submit 6-page papers (or 2 page extended abstracts for authors from industry) in English to the conference. The submission site and detailed instructions will be available through the conference website soon.

We are particularly interested in works that address the grand challenges facing humanity in areas of health, food and water security, pollution, climate change adaptation and cyber-physical systems even though they may be of exploratory nature.

Proposals and papers for invited sessions are especially welcome. They should contain the title of the session, a list of at least 5 speakers and titles of their papers, together with papers completed according to the above instructions. Please address requests and questions to the organizers.

AdCONIP 2021 organizing committee is in the process of having the conference proceedings indexed. Extended versions of selected high-quality papers will be invited to submit to special issues in international journals. Details will be posted through the conference website.

## Manuscript Requirements
All papers and invited session proposals must be written in English and submitted through PaperCept. Dates will be announced soon.
