## Description

We are currently at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) or Industry 4.0 that is poised to reshape all the sectors of economy and society with an unprecedented depth and breadth. Emerging technologies including complex organization and systems, smart sensing, industrial robotics, industrial wireless communications, industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), Internet-of-Moving-Things (IoMT), industrial cloud, industrial big data and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have become hotspots of research and innovation globally. 

Process data analytic methods rely on the notion of sensor fusion whereby data from many sensors and alarm tags are combined with process information, such as physical connectivity of process units, to give a holistic picture of health of an integrated plant. The fusion of information from such disparate sources of data is the key step in devising methodologies for smart strategies for process data analytics.

In the context of the application of analytics in the process industry, the objective in this workshop is to introduce participants to tools, techniques and a framework for seamless integration of information from process and alarm databases complemented with process connectivity information. The discovery of information from such diverse and complex data sources can be subsequently used for process and performance monitoring including alarm rationalization, root cause diagnosis of process faults, hazard and operability (Hazop) analysis, safe and optimal process operation. Such multivariate process data analytics involves information extraction from routine process data, that is typically non-categorical (as in numerical process data from sensors), plus categorical (or non-numerical or qualitative and binary) data from Alarm and Event (A&E) logs combined with process connectivity or topology information that can be inferred from the data through causality analysis or as obtained from piping and instrument diagrams of a process. The later refers to the capture of material flow streams in process units as well information flow-paths in the process due to control loops. 

Highly interconnected process plants are now common and the analysis of root causes of process abnormality including predictive risk analysis is non-trivial. It is the extraction of information from the fusion of process data, alarm and event data and process connectivity that should form the backbone of a viable process data analytics strategy and this will be the main focus of this workshop. Representing process behaviour using networks is visually appealing and easy to understand. Process flowsheets and first-principles knowledge have been used to represent the interconnectivity among different unit operations and in process simulation and optimization.  Analogously, other forms of networks derived from measured data are useful in applications such as fault diagnosis, monitoring and control. Finally, for efficient and informative analytics, data analysis is ideally carried out in the temporal as well as spectral domains, on a multitude and NOT singular sensor signal time-trends to detect process abnormality, ideally in a predictive mode.

The emphasis in this workshop will be on tools and techniques that help in the process of understanding data and discovering information that will lead to predictive monitoring, reconstructing network representations from data and diagnosis of process faults.

Typical process data analytic methods require the execution of following steps:

1. Data quality assessment including outlier detection and noise filtering
2. Data visualization and segmentation
3. Process and performance monitoring including root cause detection of faults
4. Alarm data analysis
5. Data-based process topology discovery and validation

## Desired prerequisites for attendees
Basic knowledge of statistics and linear algebra

## Target audience
The intended audience for this workshop would be industrial practitioners of control including vendors working in the area of on-line data logging and archiving, graduate students with interests in statistical learning and data science and academics.

# Workshop 2: Making reinforcement learning a practical technology for industrial control

## Overview
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an emerging technology in process systems engineering (PSE) [1,2]. The objective in RL is to generate an optimal “policy” in a stochastic environment [3]. This general formulation makes RL appealing for both control and operational decision-making tasks, notably, without a system model [2]. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding RL, there are also reasons to be skeptical of its viability. For example, RL does not have strong stability or constraint satisfaction guarantees, and it is notoriously data-hungry. Recent work at the intersection of RL and PSE strives to mitigate these issues and ultimately make RL more reliable, scaleable, and interpretable [4–7]. This workshop aims to engage academics and industrial practitioners in both the machine learning and controls communities with a lively discussion on the challenges and opportunities surrounding real-world RL.
