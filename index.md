# Overview
The International Symposium on Advanced Control of Industrial Processes (AdCONIP) is a triennial international conference. AdCONIP 2022 is the seventh symposium following previous events at Kumamoto (2002), Seoul (2005), Jasper (2008), Hangzhou (2011), Hiroshima (2014), Taipei (2017).

This symposium aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss the state of the art developments/techniques in advanced control and its applications in industrial processes. The emphasis of this symposium will be on the theory and practice of advanced industrial control methods.

Main topics for the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:
