<h2>The case for switched control and estimation and its application in the automotive sector</h2>

**Abstract:** Since the topic of sliding mode control was introduced to the international control community following early pioneering work in the former Soviet Union in the 1960’s, the methodology has received a great deal of attention across a broad range of application domains. Fundamental to the approach is its total invariance to an important class of parameter variations and uncertainty. A further advantage is that the dynamic behaviour of the system may be directly tailored by the choice of a so-called switching function - essentially this switching function can be thought of as a measure of the desired performance. This presentation will begin with a review of the basic properties and terminology of such discontinuous controllers. By appealing to highly conserved and robust controllers from biology, the case for discontinuous control as an underpinning element for robustness in both the control and observation of large scale and complex systems will be made. Recent work with the automotive sector will then be considered where the disruptive effect of the introduction of electric vehicles has stimulated industry to completely revisit established designs and supply chains. Work will be described which has used sliding mode techniques to develop Anti-Lock Braking Systems (ABSs) for next generation electric vehicles. The performance of an intelligent hybrid distribution scheme, which accommodates the constraints of a regenerative braking system to achieve high energy recuperation across a range of braking modes will finally be reviewed.

<h2>The Role of Process Systems Engineering (PSE) on the Path to Carbon Neutral Chemical Process Industry</h2>

**Abstract:** Despite the clear mandate towards the goal of carbon neutrality, the current pace of progress for the transition to renewable energy and the decarbonization of chemicals production is rather slow. The key challenge facing countries and industries is identifying low-carbon solutions that are economically feasible yet impactful in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Process systems engineering (PSE) is a field of research that applies methodological guidelines and systematic tools for process synthesis, design, operation, and evaluation. In this regard, PSE plays a critical role as an intermediary, bridging bench-scale R&D to higher-level policy and deployment decisions. In this talk, we examine the various paths to achieving carbon-neutrality including recycling, carbon capture and conversion, (CCU) and bioconversion, and important factors for them to succeed. We discuss the role of PSE tools, e.g., modeling, optimization, and life-cycle analysis, to assess their feasibilities and to build the most realistic path forward by combining them. Computer-aided tools for analysis and synthesis can be extremely helpful and the software called ArKaTAC3 being developed for this purpose will be introduced.
